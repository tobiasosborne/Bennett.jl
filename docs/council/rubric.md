# Vision-document rubric — the council's scale

The rubric the council (`docs/council/README.md`) uses to grade
`Bennett-NorthStar.md`, the from-scratch reboot vision for Bennett. Eight
criteria, each scored 1–5 on an absolute scale, plus blocking issues and a
verdict. Scores are advisory; the maintainer decides.

## What is being graded

A **vision document**, not an implementation. The current Bennett.jl and
BennettVM.jl are declared deprecated as designs; the document describes
what the reboot must become. Grade the vision for being the right vision,
stated so that strangers could build it. Do not deduct for "this does not
exist yet". Do deduct, and block, for a technical premise that is false
(for example a claim about what LLVM permits without a fork), an internal
contradiction, a missing load-bearing piece, or ambition that is incoherent
rather than merely large.

## The standard

The maintainer's standard: **unreasonably ambitious, and right.** The
document should read as the founding document of the abstraction layer
quantum programming has lacked, the way the PTX ISA document, the JVM
specification, or the LLVM language reference read for their domains. The
question for each criterion is whether a hardware vendor, a language
designer, and a compiler engineer could each read this and know what to
build and why it will matter.

- **Scores are absolute**, not on a curve, and never relative to the
  current code.
- **Ambition is a virtue; vagueness is not.** A bold claim stated
  precisely scores; a bold claim that hides a contradiction does not.
- **Skepticism is required.** Verify technical premises against your own
  knowledge of LLVM, Enzyme, PTX, QIR, OpenQASM, MLIR, Catalyst, CUDA-Q,
  Silq, Q#, Quipper, Tower, and the reversible-computing and
  resource-estimation literature. Name the premise if it is wrong.
- **Blocking means blocking.** A blocking issue is one that, uncorrected,
  would make the project build the wrong thing. Everything else is a
  suggestion.

### Scale

- **5:** founding-document quality. Precise, complete for its level,
  premises verified, nothing load-bearing missing, nothing superfluous.
- **4:** right, with one gap a domain expert names at once.
- **3:** a competent plan. Sound but generic; nothing a field would rally
  around.
- **2:** aspirational. Direction is visible, but premises are unexamined or
  key pieces are missing.
- **1:** incoherent, or built on a false premise.

## Criteria

### C1 Ambition and coherence

Is the north star unreasonably ambitious *and* internally coherent? Do the
thesis, the decisions, the architecture, and the demo ladder describe one
thing, or several things stapled together?

### C2 Technical premises

Are the technical claims true? In particular: that the dialect can live in
LLVM IR through sanctioned extension points without a fork (target
extension types, address spaces, intrinsics with attribute-stated legality,
function-granularity adjoint/control, lifetime intrinsics, loop metadata);
that the Enzyme plugin model (optimise, transform, optimise) transfers; that
the GPU offload model fits the taint tiers; that the pass-plugin entry point
and the needed analyses are C++-only; the stated problems with QIR.

### C3 The quantum VM as the revolution

Is the VM articulated as the abstraction layer quantum programming lacks,
with a clear account of what it abstracts (virtual qubits, allocation
classes, bounded dynamic control flow, garbage as a scheduled resource, the
resource vector, the effect tape)? Are the pre-VM-era lessons the right
ones? Is the "circuit model as the bounded specialisation of the VM" claim
sound, and is the padded-to-maximum semantics for loops in superposition
stated honestly?

### C4 Modularity and independence

Is the split into independent repositories right? Are the two contracts
(dialect spec, ISA spec) sufficient for every pair of components to
communicate, and are they the *only* coupling? Could each repository be
replaced by a competitor's implementation of the same spec? Where is a
monolith hiding?

### C5 Universality without forking

Is "any LLVM language, invisibly, with no fork" credible as stated? Are the
costs (optimiser not reversibility-aware, regions must be functions,
per-LLVM-version builds) the real costs, and are any missing? Is the
host/device split the right place for the classical/reversible/quantum
boundary?

### C6 Verifiability and success criteria

Is the demo ladder measurable, ordered, and sufficient to define success?
Is "correct" defined as differential equivalence against native execution
rather than as a reversibility check? Is proof-carrying output and
resource estimation without materialised gates a coherent verification and
cost story?

### C7 Position in the landscape

Does the document understand prior art (QIR, OpenQASM 3, MLIR dialects,
Catalyst, CUDA-Q, Silq, Q#, Quipper, Tower, Qualtran-style resource
estimation, reversible-computing pebbling literature) and state precisely
what is new? Is anything claimed as new that is not? Is anything existing
ignored that should be built on or interoperated with?

### C8 Clarity and completeness as a document

Could the three readers (hardware vendor, language designer, compiler
engineer) each read this and know what to build? Are the open technical
questions the right ones, correctly deferred, and is anything deferred that
is actually load-bearing for the vision?

## What the council returns

Per criterion: a score 1–5, one or two sentences of evidence pointing at
the document's text, and the single change that would most raise the
score.

Then:

- **blocking**: a list (possibly empty) of blocking issues, each with a
  short id, the section it concerns, the problem, and the fix. Blocking
  means the project would build the wrong thing if uncorrected.
- **suggestions**: non-blocking improvements, ranked.
- **verdict**: `accept` (ready as the founding vision, blocking list
  empty), `revise` (right direction, blocking issues to fix), or `reject`
  (wrong direction or false premise at the core).
- **summary**: one paragraph.

Consensus is reached when every member returns `accept` with an empty
blocking list. The loop runs at most three rounds.
